# CanvasTextInputForKA

Creating a text input inside of a KA project has been a huge issue for many users for a long time. Myself included. I created a small library for myself to use a few years back, but it was very incomplete. It didn't automatically scroll text, it didn't allow text selection, and you could only add/remove from the very end of the input, no inserting allowed.
However, this new library is different. This library is completely feature-complete and will serve all the needs of every Khan Academy programmer far and wide, both in the webpage enviroment and the PJS environment.

I also have a version of this library for use off of KA, which can be found [here](https://github.com/OOPS-Studio/CanvasTextInput) along with an entire page of info and a complete documentation.
